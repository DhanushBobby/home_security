## Introduction

The **Home Security** project aims to provide an extra layer of security for your home by detecting intruders who enter your home without your knowledge. Using an Arduino Uno and specialized programming in C++, the system can be activated when no occupants are present at home.

## Features

- Automatic Intruder Detection: The system is designed to automatically detect unauthorized individuals who enter your home while the system is activated.
- Occupancy-Based Activation: The security system is activated only when no occupants are present at home, reducing false alarms and conserving energy.
- Arduino Uno Platform: The project utilizes Arduino Uno, a widely accessible microcontroller platform, and is programmed using C++.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Assembly**: Connect the necessary components to your Arduino Uno following the provided schematic (schematic diagram can be included if available).

2. **Upload Code**: Use the Arduino IDE to upload the provided C++ code (`home_security.ino`) to your Arduino Uno.

3. **Activation**: Before leaving your home, switch on the Home Security system. It will only become active if no occupants are detected in the home.

## Usage

1. **Activating the System**: Ensure that no one is present at home and switch on the security system. The system will now monitor for any intruders.

2. **Deactivating the System**: When you return home, switch off the security system to deactivate it.
